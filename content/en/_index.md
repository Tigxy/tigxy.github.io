about_me: |
    My name is **Chris**. Through my studies, various projects, and academic research at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://jku.at), Austria, I have gained lots of experience in the application and development of AI algorithms. Lately, I have also aquired hands-on experience at [Deezer Research](https://research.deezer.com/) in Paris, where I focused on building multimodal music recommender systems that scale to millions of users and tracks.

    Next to my professional career, I am part of a local non-profit called ["Rural Youth" (Landjugend)](https://landjugend.at/), in which I have honed a wide variety of soft skills while taking on several positions, such as leading a local branch and through acting as a representative for our European-level umbrella organization.
