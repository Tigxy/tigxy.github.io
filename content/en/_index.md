about_me: |
    I'm Christian Ganhör - but please, just call me **Chris**. 
    
    Through my studies, various projects, and academic research at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://jku.at), Austria, I've gained extensive experience in developing and applying AI algorithms. After an inspiring internship at [Deezer Research](https://research.deezer.com/) in Paris, France, I'm now thrilled to be working as an **AI/ML Engineer** at [NXAI](https://nx-ai.com) back home in Austria, where I help bring cutting-edge research into real-world applications.

    Outside of work, I'm an active member of ["Rural Youth" (Landjugend)](https://landjugend.at/), a local non-profit that's been a big part of my personal growth. Through seminars, workshops, and leadership roles — from running a local branch to representing our community across Europe — I've gained invaluable experience in teamwork, communication, and leadership.

    If you'd like to learn more about my [professional experience](work), [education](education), or [publications](publications), feel free to explore the dedicated sections of this website.
